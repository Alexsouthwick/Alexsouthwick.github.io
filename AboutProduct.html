            <h1> About Cadenza</h1>

            <div class="info">
                <p> Cadenza is a product with the mission of making music composition more accessible to everyone. Currently, features include dragging and dropping note patterns into designated areas to align with the beats, playing a song, and selecting a beat pattern. Some things we hope to implement in the future are giving users the option to play their song with different instruments, allowing for more customization of beats, and giving a user sheet music and an mp3 file of their newly-created song. </p>

            <h2> About Us </h2>
             <div class="info">
                <p> We began working on this project summer of 2016 during our Adobe SF Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program. Having all come from musical backgrounds, we were intrigued by the idea of creating a program to compose music and we immediately began planning to work on this project weeks before it was assigned. Although we were extremely ambitious at the outset (some might say too ambitious), we have learned a lot and are proud of the work we've accomplished these past two weeks. </p>

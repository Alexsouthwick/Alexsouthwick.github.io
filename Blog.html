            <p id = "entry"> 
            <b>Monday 8/1, Alex: </b>  Today was mostly brainstorming and firming up ideas. We wrote our MVP, stretch goals and our general “marketing strategy”. We also drew out a basic prototype for how we want it to look on Photoshop. We decided to make two set rhythms that the user can choose from, and assigning the notes to those rhythms. Chloe started by looking up possible rhythms and coding it out in a rectangular format. Shruti started researching ways in which we could include the audio part of our website and started testing different programs. I started researching how to make drag and drop blocks, and made the basic outline of the blocks and bar. We have made a schedule and are prepared for the rest of the week. I am excited about this project and I am sure that we can complete everything we want!

        <h4> Day 2 </h4>
            <p id = "entry"> 
            <b>Tuesday 8/2, Shruti: </b> Today we made a lot of progress on our project. Alex was able to create multiple draggable objects, and she found the length of the list! Chloe was able to create two rhythms (“Disney” and “Allegro”) and make the appropriate one appear under a draggable note box when clicked [and, to indicate selection, changes the color of the button]. I finished creating the pause button and created 4 individual buttons, each playing separate melodies (4 notes each) using the oscillator. Even though we’ve encountered numerous errors today (some still unresolved), I’m proud to say we’re actually ahead of schedule.

            <h4> Day 3 </h4>
            <p id = "entry"> 
            <b>Wednesday 8/3, Chloe: </b> Today was a major work day for us. After laying down the groundwork on Monday and Tuesday, we began the difficult job of implementing the integral components of our website, including playing the song. This morning, Shruti greeted us with the news that she would have to spend a day figuring out how to use the oscillator to play the notes for different durations of time. Without it, the oscillator would naturally play all the notes for the same length of time (1000 divided by one specific number). In order to go around it, Shruti plans to use a dictionary to assign the note name (e.g. half, quarter, sixteenth, etc.) to the number by which 1000 divides and then run through a list to play all notes for the correct duration. Alex and Shruti spent the day working on adding elements to a song list. So, when the draggable object with the note combination is dragged into a droppable object, it adds the specific set of notes, in that order, to a list, which will be played when we press the play button (which we hope to implement later). I extended the Disney and the Allegro patterns to 12 measures each and finished the horizontal scroll on the window with the beats and the Drag-and-Drop. I also created a side panel to put the note combinations with a menu panel at the top for the different number of notes in the note combination. (Users must match the number of notes in the note combination to the number of notes in the measure (indicated by the rectangular blocks).

            <h4> Day 4 </h4>
            <p id = "entry"> 
            <b>Thursday 8/4, Alex:</b> Today was a less intense workday today but we still got a lot done. We got text to appear on the droppable blocks when the draggable blocks are dropped in and we spent a lot of time fixing a bug that made the blocks move down when the text was changed. For some reason whenever we pulled or pushed our javascript file, parts of the code were duplicated. When I tried to delete some of the duplicates, a bug appeared that made the music not play. Shruti spent a lot of the day trying to make a final edit of the files because the duplicated were creating bugs. She (with the help of Erica) finally managed to make a final draft of the js file that didn’t have any bugs; we just have to be more careful pulling and pushing in the future. I added a basic homepage for our site that links to our blog, more information, and the application itself. I also added a home button to the app site so that people can go home from the app. I think we have come really far and I’m excited to see what else we can do with this project.

            <h4> Day 5 </h4>
            <p id = "entry"> 
            <b>Friday 8/5, Shruti:</b>Today was a slow day for us. Chloe made the clear button physically clear the song, so users could restart a song. Alex worked on making our site more user friendly and better to look at (aka a smort looking website). She changed site colors and formatting. Chloe and Alex worked together to add links to the blog and other features on our home page. Today,  I cleaned up some previous bugs and experimented with the oscillator to try to change the durations of the notes to match rhythms - a process that is still in progress. Even though today was a slow day, I’m really proud of where we currently are with our site and I’m excited to present our product next week!

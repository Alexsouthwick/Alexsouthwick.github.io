            <b>Monday 8/1, Alex: </b>  Today was mostly brainstorming and firming up ideas. We wrote our MVP, stretch goals and our general “marketing strategy”. We also drew out a basic prototype for how we want it to look on Photoshop. We decided to make two set rhythms that the user can choose from, and assigning the notes to those rhythms. Chloe started by looking up possible rhythms and coding it out in a rectangular format. Shruti started researching ways in which we could include the audio part of our website and started testing different programs. I started researching how to make drag and drop blocks, and made the basic outline of the blocks and bar. We have made a schedule and are prepared for the rest of the week. I am excited about this project and I am sure that we can complete everything we want!

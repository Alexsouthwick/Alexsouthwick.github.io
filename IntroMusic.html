            <h1> Intro to Music</h1>

            <div class= "info">
                <p> The most fundamental part of music is a scale. A scale is an ordered sequence of notes (usually 8 notes) and serves as the base for all further note combinations. The most basic scale is the scale ranging from middle C to high C. </p>

                <p> All music is divided with bar lines into units of notes called measures. In Cadenza, we have draggable blocks for each of our measures to make creating songs easier.</p>

                <p> Cadenza also gives you pre-made note blocks designed by our music theory experts [the Smorts]. We use chord patterns to make our blocks of music. </p>

                <p> The last fundamental concept in music involves how long you hold a note. A whole note is the longest, held for four counts. A half note is held for two counts. A quarter note, the most common type of note, is held for one count. An eighth note is held for a half a count. The shortest note, a sixteenth note, is held for one fourth of a count. In Cadenza, our beats are represented with black rectangle. The longer the rectangle is, the longer the note will be held. Also if you are making your own rhythm, the length of notes is represented through dashes. Two dashes equal a quarter note. So one dash is an eighth note, four dashes is a half note etc. Just like with the black rectangles, the longer the set of dashes is, the longer the note will be held.

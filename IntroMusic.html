            <div class= "info">
                <p> The most fundamental part of music is a scale. A scale is an ordered sequence of notes (usually 8 notes) and serves as the base for all further note combinations. The most basic scale is the scale ranging from middle C to high C. </p>

                <p> All music is divided with bar lines into units of notes called measures. In Cadenza, we have draggable blocks for each of our measures to make creating songs easier.</p>
